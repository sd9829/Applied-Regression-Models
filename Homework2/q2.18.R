# Note to professor/grader - I use Pycharm to write R code and it only runs by highlighting certain parts. so if I
# don't see something you expect to see on a plot, I run the lines one block after another, but I hear it is an IDE
# issue. So if your IDE behaves similarly, I wanted you to know! Thank you.
