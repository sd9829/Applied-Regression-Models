📊 **Linear Regression Homework (R)
**
This repository contains my homework assignments for the Linear Regression Analysis course, based on examples and exercises from
Introduction to Linear Regression Analysis (5th Edition) by Montgomery, Peck, and Vining.

Each R script demonstrates the application of simple and multiple linear regression techniques to real-world datasets, including:

Fitting linear regression models using lm()

Conducting model significance tests (ANOVA, t-tests, F-tests)

Assessing model fit using 
R2
R
2
 and residual diagnostics

Constructing and visualizing 95% confidence and prediction intervals/bands

Interpreting regression output in the context of the data

🧮 Structure

Each script corresponds to a specific textbook exercise or dataset.

Scripts are named descriptively (e.g., regression_toluene.R, ad_spending.R).

Each script includes clear comments explaining each step of the analysis:

Data setup

Model fitting

Model analysis

Band/interval construction and plotting

📦 Requirements

R (version ≥ 4.0)

Base R packages only (no external libraries needed)
