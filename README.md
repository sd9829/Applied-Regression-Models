# üìä Linear Regression Homework (R)

This repository contains my homework assignments for the **Linear Regression Analysis** course, based on examples and exercises from  
*Introduction to Linear Regression Analysis (5th Edition)* by Montgomery, Peck, and Vining.

Each R script demonstrates the application of **simple and multiple linear regression** techniques to real-world datasets, including:

- Fitting linear regression models using `lm()`
- Conducting model significance tests (ANOVA, t-tests, F-tests)
- Assessing model fit using \(R^2\) and residual diagnostics
- Constructing and visualizing 95% confidence and prediction intervals/bands
- Interpreting regression output in the context of the data

---

## üìÅ Structure

- Each script corresponds to a specific textbook exercise or dataset.
- Scripts are named descriptively (e.g., `regression_toluene.R`, `ad_spending.R`).
- Each script includes clear comments explaining each step of the analysis:
  - Data setup
  - Model fitting
  - Model analysis
  - Band/interval construction and plotting
